1. An object represents a specific instance of a data structure or entity in Python.

2. A class is a blueprint or template for creating objects, defining their attributes and behaviors. An object, also known as an instance, is an individual entity created from a class.

3. Immutable objects cannot be modified after creation, while mutable objects can be altered. Immutable objects create a new instance when modified, whereas mutable objects are modified in place.

4. A reference is a pointer or identifier that connects a variable to an object in memory.

5. Assignment is the process of binding a variable to an object, allowing you to work with and manipulate the object using the variable.

6. An alias is a secondary name for an object, typically created when multiple variables reference the same object.

7. To check if two variables are identical, you can use the `is` operator.

8. To determine if two variables reference the same object, you can use the `id()` function.

9. To display the variable identifier (memory address) in CPython, you can use the `id()` function.

10. Mutable objects can be changed after creation, while immutable objects cannot be modified once created.

11. Built-in mutable types in Python include lists, dictionaries, and sets.

12. Built-in immutable types in Python include integers, strings, tuples, and frozensets.

13. Python passes variables to functions using a call-by-object reference mechanism, where the function receives a reference to the object passed, enabling changes to the object inside the function to be visible outside.
