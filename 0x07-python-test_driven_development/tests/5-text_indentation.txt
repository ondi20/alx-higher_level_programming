"""
Defines a text-indentation function.

This module provides a function, 'text_indentation', that takes a text as input and prints the text with two new lines after each '.', '?', and ':' characters. This is a simple way to add proper indentation to text for better readability.

"""

def text_indentation(text):
    """Print text with two new lines after each '.', '?', and ':'.

    Args:
        text (str): The text to be processed and printed with proper indentation.

    Raises:
        TypeError: If 'text' is not a string.

    This function processes the input 'text' and adds two new lines after each '.', '?', and ':' characters to ensure proper indentation. The result is printed to the console.

    Example:
    >>> text = "This is a sample text. It contains multiple sentences? And some colons: like this."
    >>> text_indentation(text)
    This is a sample text.

    It contains multiple sentences?

    And some colons:

    like this.
